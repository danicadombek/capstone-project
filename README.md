## A hearty welcome to "Viary" - a place, where you can keep your little memorys alive.

This is my capstone-project of the 3 month web development bootcamp at neue fische. ItÂ´s optimized for mobile usage 375 x 667 (iPhone 6,7,8).

[Here](https://capstone-project-cdo928zsu-danicadombek.vercel.app/) you can see the app in vercel.

## About this app

Viary - short for virtual diary - a mobile "place" for cherished memories in picture format. Just like a real diary.

After all, there are always experiences in life that should not simply "go down" in the gallery but take an important & manageable place.
